# Summary:  Package a single executable — and for Windows a portable zip holding the
#           privatium-data folder with the example apps — name every archive a release
#           carries, and require successful CI for a release commit, waiting for a
#           run still in progress.
#           See main README.md for full license information.

Keep privatium.exe and the privatium-data folder together: while that folder sits
beside the program, everything Privatium knows lives in it and nothing is written
anywhere else on this computer (spec/cli.md section 1).

  privatium-data\\apps      the apps; three examples to start with
  privatium-data\\data      your information, as plain text files
  privatium-data\\identity  this node's keys; keep private

Back up by copying this whole folder. Move it, and the program follows.
Delete privatium-data (after copying it) to use the platform data directory instead.
