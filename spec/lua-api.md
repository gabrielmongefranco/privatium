# Lua API — Tier 1

Tier 1 apps are written in Lua 5.4 and HTML templates. No build step, no compilation, no
restart. Save a file, refresh the browser, see the change.

---

## 1. Why Lua, and why 5.4

Lua exists to be embedded in a host application with a sandbox. nginx, Redis, Neovim,
World of Warcraft, and Roblox all arrived at it independently. It is a small language a
non-professional can learn in an afternoon, and it is far easier to hold in your head than
JavaScript or Rust.

**Lua 5.4 via `mlua`**, not LuaJIT and not Luau:

- **Not LuaJIT** — iOS forbids JIT compilation (W^X). A LuaJIT core cannot ship in the
  mobile shells, and LuaJIT is frozen at 5.1 semantics.
- **Not Luau** — genuinely attractive (gradual typing, sandboxing by design), but it is a
  dialect. Dialects break the "paste a snippet from the internet" experience that makes Lua
  approachable, and they degrade LLM assistance.
- **5.4** gives integer/float distinction, `goto`, to-be-closed variables, and a generational
  GC, with the largest body of ordinary Lua documentation behind it.

### 1.1 What Privatium does NOT use

The Barracuda App Server (BAS) and Mako Server were evaluated as a foundation and rejected
for two independent reasons:

1. **License.** The BAS library is distributed under a non-commercial license while the
   surrounding Lua is MIT. GPL-3.0 requires granting downstream users rights that a
   non-commercial license withholds. The combination is undistributable.
2. **Sandbox posture.** BAS executes Lua as trusted manufacturer logic with unrestricted
   Lua-to-C binding access. Privatium treats an app folder as semi-trusted code the owner
   downloaded. Opposite threat models.

Lua Server Pages, as a *concept*, is excellent and is reimplemented here (§4). The idea was
worth taking; the library was not.

## 2. App layout

```
apps/<slug>/
├── app.toml            manifest (tier = "lua")
├── app.lua             REQUIRED  entry point
├── lib/                your own modules; require'd by name
├── views/              LSP templates (.lsp)
├── static/             css, images, vendored js
├── schema.sql          OPTIONAL  tables, if you want SQL
└── SKILL.md            RECOMMENDED  see docs/skills.md
```

`static/` is served by the framework beneath the mount, at `<mount>static/*`, as a Tier 2
app's `web/` is: `url('/static/app.css')` reaches `static/app.css`. A route never sees
those paths. In solo mode the framework's own `/static/*` names come first and the app's
answer for the rest (`spec/protocol.md §9.1`).

---

## 3. The `pv` module

```lua
local pv = require 'privatium'
```

### 3.1 Routing

```lua
pv.get('/',            function(req) ... end)
pv.get('/fill/:id',    function(req) return req.params.id end)
pv.post('/fill',       function(req) ... end)
pv.route('PUT', '/x',  function(req) ... end)
```

Handlers return one of:

| Return | Result |
|---|---|
| `pv.render('index', ctx)` | Render `views/index.lsp` |
| `pv.redirect('/')` | 303 See Other |
| `pv.json(tbl)` | `application/json` |
| `pv.text(str)` | `text/plain` |
| a string | `text/html` |
| `nil` | 204 No Content |

`req` fields: `method`, `path`, `params`, `query`, `form`, `body`, `headers`, `device`
(the paired device's ID), `is_htmx` (true when `HX-Request` is present).

`path` is the path beneath the app's mount, `/` for the mount point. `query` is the query
string decoded, `form` an `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` body decoded, `body` the
body as received — at most 64 KiB, because Tier 1 does not stream — and `headers` is keyed
by lower-case name. `device` is the ID of the device the request was authenticated as;
in Phase 1 that is always this node's own ID (`docs/plans/phase-1.md §2.2`), and a paired
device's arrives with pairing. Routes register while `app.lua` loads and are matched in
registration order; a path that matches a pattern with no route for the method is a 405,
one that matches nothing a 404.

### 3.2 Reading

```lua
local rows = pv.query('SELECT * FROM fill WHERE drug = ?', {'Example'})
local one  = pv.query1('SELECT count(*) AS n FROM fill')
local row  = pv.get_row('fill', id)
```

Runs on the sandboxed SQLite connection (`spec/app-contract.md §7`), with
`cache/_sys.sqlite` attached read-only as `sys`, so `pv.query('SELECT * FROM
sys.v_app_nav')` answers (`spec/data-dictionary.md §4`). Parameters are bound, never
interpolated; string concatenation into SQL MUST be rejected by the linter. Sums over
`DECIMAL` columns use `decimal_sum()`; date arithmetic uses `date(x, '+30 days')`
(`spec/data-dictionary.md §2`). A view that reads a `$name` placeholder
(`spec/data-api.md §1`) reads NULL here — the query string that binds one belongs to the
data API — so a handler that needs the parameter writes the `SELECT` itself.

**How a result column is typed.** What SQLite holds, as Lua holds it — the rule every
SQLite binding follows: an `INTEGER` is a Lua integer, a `REAL` a Lua number, `TEXT` a
string, and a `NULL` an absent key in the row's table, never a value. So a `BIGINT` column
is a Lua integer — 64-bit and exact, since the reason JSON needs a string
(`spec/data-dictionary.md §2.1`) does not apply to Lua — `count(*) AS n` is a number, and
a `DECIMAL` column, which is text in the cache, is a **string**: Lua has no exact decimal,
and a float would lose what the text keeps. Two conveniences apply to a column that
originates in a declared column, read directly or through a view: `BOOLEAN` arrives as a
Lua boolean (an `INTEGER` `0` would be truthy in Lua), and `JSON` (`VARCHAR[]`) arrives
decoded into a table. A computed column has no declaration and follows the storage rule
alone, so `decimal_sum()` is a string. `pv.query1` returns `nil` when there is no row;
`pv.get_row` returns `nil` for an id that is absent **or whose winning event is a
tombstone** — `spec/protocol.md §4.5` materializes no row for one, exactly as the data API
answers 404 for both.

`pv.dec(s)` returns a decimal userdata from a string, an integer or another decimal —
never from a Lua float, which is refused because it is already inexact. It supports `+`,
`-`, `*`, `/`, unary minus, `==`, `<`, `<=`, `tostring`, `d:with_scale(n)`, `d:scale()`
and `d:compare(other)`, exact at the larger scale of the operands, and an operation whose
result does not fit 36 digits is an error rather than a saturated value. A quotient is not
exact, so `/` rounds half away from zero at the larger scale of the two operands —
`pv.dec('10.00') / 3` is `3.33` — and `a:div(b, scale)` does the same at a scale the
author names; a zero divisor is an error either way. Display and storage never need any
of this: a template prints the string, `fmt.money` formats it, and totals belong in SQL
(`decimal_sum`). Never convert money to a Lua number.

### 3.3 Writing

```lua
local id = pv.append('fill', { drug = 'Example', copay_amount = '12.50' })  -- mints a ULID
pv.append('fill', id, { copay_amount = '10.00' })                          -- amend by id
pv.delete('fill', id)                                                      -- tombstone

pv.batch(function(tx)                                -- atomic multi-event
  local a = tx.append('node', { kind = 'a', text = 'wombat' })   -- returns the new ULID
  local b = tx.append('node', { kind = 'a', text = 'penguin' })
  tx.append('node', existing_id, { kind = 'q', yes_id = a, no_id = b })
  tx.delete('cursor', 'cursor')
end)
```

**Signatures.** Both `pv.append` and `tx.append` accept two forms:

| Call | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `append(tbl, data)` | Mints a ULID and returns it |
| `append(tbl, id, data)` | Appends under the given `id` and returns it |

`id` may be `nil` in the three-argument form, which is equivalent to the two-argument form.
That makes `pv.append('profile', existing and existing.id or nil, data)` a legal
create-or-amend without a branch.

`tx.append` returns the minted ULID **before** the batch is written, so later events in the
same batch may reference it. A `pv.batch` either appends every event or none; the framework
assigns contiguous `seq` values to the batch, under one `ts`, writes it in one write with
its first line carrying the count, and a batch a crash landed short is skipped whole by
every reader (`spec/protocol.md §4.1`), so "every event or none" holds on the way out of
the log as well as on the way in.

**Encoding `data`.** `data` is a Lua table with string keys, written as the JSON object
`d`: a string as a string, an integer as an integer, a boolean as a boolean, a `pv.dec` as
its digits in a string, and a nested table as an array when its keys are exactly `1..n`
(an empty table is an empty array) or an object when they are all strings. A key whose
value is `nil` is absent (`spec/data-dictionary.md §2.1`).

**Typed writes.** When `schema.sql` declares the table, every value that names a declared
column is checked and normalized before the append, and a value that is not its type
refuses the whole append — the batch too — with an error naming the table and column.
Nothing reaches the log, so the log stays clean and nothing has to materialize as NULL
later (`spec/data-dictionary.md §2.1`). Keys naming no declared column pass through
untouched.

| Declared | Accepted | Written |
|---|---|---|
| `BIGINT` | a Lua integer, or a string of digits | the digits, as a string |
| `DECIMAL(p,s)` | a string, an integer, a Lua number, a `pv.dec` | the digits at scale `s`, as a string; more fractional digits than `s` holds is refused, not rounded |
| `BOOLEAN` | `true`/`false`, `'true'`/`'false'`, `'yes'`/`'no'`, `1`/`0` | `true`/`false` |
| `DATE` | `2026-09-03`, `2026/09/03`, `20260903`, `3/9/2026`, `3-9-26`, `03.09.2026`, `March 9, 2026`, `9 March 2026`, `9-Mar-2026`, `09-SEP-26`, an epoch in seconds or milliseconds, a timestamp | `YYYY-MM-DD` |
| `TIME` | `14:03`, `14:03:11`, `2:03 pm`, `9am` | `HH:MM:SS` |
| `TIMESTAMPTZ` | RFC 3339 with `Z` or an offset, `2026-09-03 14:03[:11]` or with `T` (read as UTC), a date (midnight UTC), `3/9/2026 2:30 pm`, an epoch | RFC 3339 UTC to the millisecond |

Where a numeric date's day and month are both twelve or less, `ui.date_format = "eu"`
reads the day first and anything else the month first; a two-digit year `00`–`69` is this
century and `70`–`99` the last. The same normalization applies to `sample/seed.jsonl` and
to the data API.

**Constraints.** After normalization, every put is held against the schema's `NOT NULL`
and `CHECK` constraints — the author's own DDL, run by the engine — and a violation refuses
the whole append naming the table, the event's index in the batch and what SQLite said.
`spec/data-api.md §2` promises this for the API; there is one write path, so `pv.append`,
`pv.batch` and the seed get the same answer.

Inside `pv.batch`, `pv.append` and `pv.delete` are errors — `tx.append` and `tx.delete`
are the batch — and `pv.batch` does not nest; a `tx` used after its function returned is
an error. An error raised anywhere in the function discards the batch. `pv.on('append')`
handlers run for each event after the batch is written, in the VM that wrote it; a
handler that errors fails the request, but the batch is already durable.

### 3.4 Other

```lua
pv.ulid()                     -- fresh ULID
pv.now()                      -- RFC 3339 UTC string
pv.device()                   -- the device this request is from; this node's ID in Phase 1
pv.node()                     -- { id, name, solo, peers, restore_tier }
pv.setting('key', default)    -- read a sys_setting; `default` when the key is unset
pv.log('info', 'message')     -- the diagnostic log; never write to stdout directly
pv.on('append', function(ev) ... end)   -- server-side reaction to any event
```

`pv.node()`: `id` is the Node ID; `name` is `sys_node.display_name`, or the Node ID while
the owner has set none (as `spec/protocol.md §9.2`'s manifest does); `solo` is whether the
node runs in solo mode; `peers` is the number of paired **nodes** — active `sys_device`
rows with `kind = 'node'` other than this one, so a paired phone or browser does not
count — and is `0` until a second node is admitted;
`restore_tier` is `1`, `2` or `3` for the tier that built this app's cache
(`spec/protocol.md §5.3`), or `nil` for an app this node has not materialized.

`pv.setting(key, default)` returns `sys_setting.value` decoded from its JSON — `"365"` is
the string, `365` the number — or `default` when no row has that key; with no default,
`nil`.

`pv.log(level, message)`, with `level` one of `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, writes one
line to the node's **diagnostic log** — its standard error in Phase 1, prefixed with the
app's slug — and nowhere else: never the event log, never `sys_audit`. `print` is routed
there too, as `info`, so an app cannot write to the node's standard output at all.

`pv.on('append', fn)` fires `fn(ev)` — `ev` being the envelope of `spec/protocol.md §4.1`
with `d` decoded — for **every event this node appends**: a handler's `pv.append`,
`pv.delete` or `pv.batch`, and the owner loading `sample/seed.jsonl`
(`spec/app-contract.md §9`). It fires synchronously after the write, in the VM that wrote
(any VM, for the seed), once per event in order; a handler that appends fires it again,
bounded only by the request's limits, so guard against loops. When sync exists it fires
for events arriving from other devices too, which is how you write "when a fill lands,
recompute the refill window."

Routes and `pv.on` register only while `app.lua` loads; `pv.query`, `pv.append`,
`pv.node`, `pv.setting` and their kin run only inside a request. Calling either at the
wrong time is an error.

## 4. LSP templates

`views/*.lsp` is HTML with embedded Lua. Compiled once to a Lua chunk, cached, invalidated
on file mtime. In development that means **save, refresh, done** — no build, no restart.

```html
<!-- views/index.lsp -->
<h1>Upcoming refills</h1>

<? if #fills == 0 then ?>
  <p class="empty">Nothing due. <?= icon('check-circle') ?></p>
<? else ?>
  <ul>
  <? for _, f in ipairs(fills) do ?>
    <li>
      <?= f.drug ?> — due <?= fmt.date(f.due_on) ?>
      <button hx-delete="/fill/<?= f.id ?>" hx-target="closest li">
        <?= icon('trash', 'Delete this fill') ?>
      </button>
    </li>
  <? end ?>
  </ul>
<? end ?>
```

| Tag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `<? ... ?>` | Execute Lua, emit nothing |
| `<?= expr ?>` | Emit `expr`, **HTML-escaped** |
| `<?raw expr ?>` | Emit unescaped. Flagged by the linter every time it appears. |
| `<?-- ... --?>` | Comment, stripped |

**Escaping is the default and is not optional.** `<?= ?>` always escapes. There is no
configuration flag to change this. `<?raw ?>` exists because escaping cannot be universal,
and its presence in a diff is a review trigger.

**What `<?= ?>` emits.** A string, a number, a boolean, or a value with a `tostring` (a
`pv.dec`) is emitted as text, escaped; `nil` emits nothing; a table or a function is an
error naming the template line. The one thing not escaped is markup the framework itself
produced: `icon()`, `csrf()`, `render()` and a layout's `content` return an **HTML value**
that `<?= ?>` emits as it is. It is a value, not a flag — concatenating it into a string
(`'x ' .. icon('gear')`) yields a plain string, which is then escaped like any other. Data
never becomes markup except through `<?raw ?>`. A `<?-- --?>` comment is stripped whatever
it contains, tags included.

### 4.0 Where helpers are available

`url`, `icon`, `fmt.*`, and `t` are available **both in templates and in handler code**, as
globals in the app's sandbox. `render`, `layout`, and `csrf` are template-only.

```lua
pv.post('/name', function(req)          -- url() in a handler
  return pv.redirect(url('/'))
end)
```

`pv.url(path)` is available as an alias of the global `url(path)`, identical in behaviour.
Both exist because `PV301` and `spec/protocol.md §9.1` refer to the qualified form, while
sandbox code more naturally reaches for the bare one. Implementations MUST provide both.

Hardcoding `/a/<slug>/...` anywhere — handler or template — breaks the app in solo mode and
is rejected by `privatium lint` rule `PV301`.

### 4.1 Helpers available in every template

| Helper | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `render('partial', ctx)` | Include another template |
| `layout('base')` | Wrap this template in `views/base.lsp` |
| `icon(name[, label])` | Inline a Bootstrap Icon (`docs/icons.md`) |
| `url('/path')` | Mount-aware URL (host mode prefixes `/a/<slug>`, solo mode does not) |
| `fmt.date`, `fmt.money`, `fmt.rel` | Locale-aware formatting from `sys_setting` |
| `csrf()` | Hidden CSRF field. Required in every non-GET form. |
| `t('key')` | Translation lookup, if `locales/` exists |

`url()` is not cosmetic — hardcoding `/a/myapp/...` breaks the app in solo mode. The linter
flags literal mount paths.

`icon(name[, label])` takes the label as a **string**, the second positional argument;
there is no options table and no `size` option — an icon is `1em` and scales with
`font-size`. `fmt.date` follows `ui.date_format` (`iso` | `us` | `eu`); `fmt.money`
renders two places, grouped, with the point and the group separator `ui.locale` implies
(`spec/data-dictionary.md §3.6`); `fmt.rel` is a relative time (`just now`, `3 days ago`,
`in 2 hours`). Each returns a value it cannot parse unchanged. `t(key)` returns `key`
unchanged while no `locales/` format exists, which is all of `pv/1`.

`csrf()` emits a hidden `_csrf` field whose token is bound to the app's mount for the life
of the process (`docs/plans/phase-1.md §2.2`). The host MUST verify it on every non-GET
request beneath the mount — as the `_csrf` form field, or as an `X-CSRF-Token` header for
a request that carries no form, such as `hx-delete` on a button — and refuse a request
without it with 403 before any handler runs. The page frame (below) puts the token in
`hx-headers` on `<body>`, so every request htmx makes beneath the mount carries the header
with nothing for the author to do; a view that owns its document with `layout()` supplies
it the same way, or with `hx-include="[name=_csrf]"`. `_csrf` stays visible in `req.form`.

**The page around a view.** A view that calls no `layout()` is rendered inside the
framework's page frame: the document head with the app's title, the shell's stylesheet
and htmx, a header with the way back, and `<main>`; the view supplies the page's one
`<h1>`. `layout('base')` replaces that with `views/base.lsp`, which runs after the view
with the same ctx plus `content`, the rendered view, and then owns the whole document —
`<?= content ?>` places it, and the framework adds nothing. `layout` is for the view
`pv.render` named; a partial calling it is an error. A request htmx makes (`HX-Request`
present, `HX-Boosted` absent) gets the view's output alone, since htmx swaps it into an
element: that is how `pv.render('_board', ctx)` answers `req.is_htmx`.

**Names in a template.** The ctx table's keys are bare names; a name absent from the ctx
is the sandbox global of that name — `ipairs`, `os.date`, `icon` — or `nil` when there is
none. So a key MUST NOT be named after a Lua builtin: `error`, `type`, `select` and `table`
are functions and tables already, and `<? if error then ?>` is always true. `err` is the
reference apps' spelling. A bare assignment in a template is request-scoped exactly as in
a handler (§5). `render('partial', ctx)` gives the partial that ctx and nothing of its
parent's.

### 4.2 Why LSP and not Jinja

The handler is Lua; the template should be Lua. Two syntaxes for one app is a tax on the
author and a source of LLM confusion. LSP's `<? ?>` is also isomorphic to PHP, ASP, EJS,
and ERB, which is an enormous body of training data — an LLM writes it correctly on the
first attempt far more often than it writes a bespoke DSL.

## 5. Sandbox

The Lua state MUST be created with these removed or replaced:

| Removed | Reason |
|---|---|
| `io` | Filesystem access. Use `pv.*`. |
| `os.execute`, `os.exit`, `os.getenv`, `os.remove`, `os.rename`, `os.tmpname` | Process and filesystem control |
| `package.loadlib`, `package.cpath` | Loading native code |
| `debug` | Escapes every other restriction |
| `load`, `loadstring`, `dofile`, `loadfile` | Arbitrary code from data |
| `os.setlocale` | Process-wide state: one app's call would change how every other app, and the node, formats a number |

`require` MUST be replaced with a loader confined to the app's own `lib/` directory plus
the framework's whitelisted modules.

Retained: `os.time`, `os.date`, `os.clock`, `string`, `table`, `math`, `coroutine`, `utf8`.

**Resource limits, all REQUIRED:**

| Limit | Default | Setting |
|---|---|---|
| Instruction count per request | 50,000,000 | `lua.max_instructions` |
| Memory per VM | 64 MB | `lua.max_memory_mb` |
| Wall clock per request | 5 s | `lua.max_seconds` |
| VM pool size | CPU count | `lua.pool_size` |

Instruction limits are enforced with a debug hook installed by the host before app code
runs; memory via a custom allocator. Exceeding a limit aborts the request, returns 500, and
writes a `lua.limit_exceeded` audit event. It MUST NOT take down the node.

**What "aborts" means.** The count is to the nearest thousand instructions. The error a
limit raises is an ordinary Lua error — a `pcall` can observe it — but the verdict is the
host's, not the handler's: the request fails with 500 and the audit row whether or not the
error was caught; from the first trip the hook fires at every instruction, so a handler
cannot loop inside a `pcall`; and the VM that tripped is discarded and rebuilt for the next
request, so a limit never poisons the pool. The wall clock is checked by the same hook
and, while a statement runs inside SQLite where the hook cannot fire, by the connection's
progress handler, which interrupts the statement on the same deadline. A single operation
that runs entirely inside the interpreter's C code — a pathological `string.find` pattern
— is stopped at its next instruction. The memory limit is the allocator refusing: an app
that catches that and lets go of what it held has not exceeded the limit; one that does
not is refused again. `app.lua` loads under the same limits.

Lua states are not thread-safe. The host maintains a pool; one request holds one VM.
**Global state.** A global assigned while `app.lua` loads — a helper function, a constant,
a table — is the VM's baseline and is visible to every request on that VM. A global
assigned inside a handler, or in a `lib/` module a handler calls, **lives until that
request ends and is never seen by another request**, on that VM or any other: the host runs
app code in an environment whose assignments are request-scoped, so one request's data
cannot leak into the next and nothing can be cached across requests by assignment. What a
handler can still do is mutate a table the baseline holds (`cache[k] = v` where `cache =
{}` was defined at load); that persists per VM and is not shared, which is the footgun the
linter checks. Apps needing shared state MUST use the event log.

---

## 6. Client-side Lua (optional)

For sharing pure-logic modules between node and browser:

| Option | Size | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **wasmoon** | ~250 KB wasm | Lua 5.4, matches the server exactly. Requires `permissions.wasm = true`. |
| **Fengari** | ~200 KB js | Lua 5.3, no WASM permission needed, slower |

Share **logic only** — validation, date math, scoring — from `lib/shared/`. Do not attempt
to share handler or template code; `pv.*` does not exist in the browser.

This is optional and off by default. Most apps never need it.

---

## 7. Development loop

```
privatium dev --app myapp
```

- Watches `app.lua`, `lib/`, `views/`, `static/`, `schema.sql`
- Lua and templates: reloaded in place, next request picks them up. **No restart.**
- `schema.sql`: triggers rematerialization from the logs, which is safe at any time
- Errors render in the browser with the Lua traceback and the offending template line
- `--open` opens the app in a browser; the QR code a phone on the LAN follows along with
  arrives with pairing (Phase 2, `spec/cli.md §2`)

The reloading is the host's, on every run, not a mode: a change is noticed by a stat on the
next request, so `privatium dev` adds nothing to it beyond its flags (`spec/cli.md §3`). A
save that does not load — a syntax error in `app.lua`, a template that does not compile —
is the error page, with the traceback and the offending line, on every request beneath
the mount until the next save loads; the code from before the error is not served in its
place.

The tight loop is the point. If a change requires a restart, that is a bug in the host.
