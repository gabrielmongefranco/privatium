// Summary:  The app loader — step 5 of docs/plans/phase-1.md §2.6 and the lifecycle of
//           spec/app-contract.md §8 up to and including mount. Discovers app folders,
//           refuses per app and loudly (§3.1), keeps sys_app as events (§3.4), and owns
//           each app's log, store and — for Tier 1 — its Lua host. The node's one public
//           append path, `Node::append`, is here too, beside load_seed, so nothing above
//           this module ever holds an app's log.
