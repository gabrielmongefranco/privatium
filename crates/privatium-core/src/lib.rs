// Summary: Crate root. The error type, the engine linkage probe, `Node::open` and the bootstrap order
//          it follows, the sink that turns what a log scan found into sys_audit rows
//          (spec/protocol.md §4.4), and the node-level API of spec/app-contract.md §6 —
//          snapshot, restore, verify, prune and maintenance routed to every loaded app's
//          store, auth_layer, query, close, the discovery and pairing methods, and LAN
//          synchronization through a bounded receive inbox. core::handle itself is
//          wire::Handler; the Lua host behind a Tier 1 mount is `lua`; append, append_batch,
//          open_app and subscribe are `app`'s.
