// Summary:  `privatium lint` (spec/cli.md §5, docs/plans/phase-1.md M12): the rule table
//           with its stable IDs, severities and spec citations; a finding and its JSON
//           shape (§5.2); the walk over an app folder that hands each file to the rule
//           module that reads it — the manifest, the schema through SQLite, Lua through a
//           full_moon AST, templates through the compiler's own front end, a Tier 2 web/
//           through a lexer — and the mechanical fixer of §5.3. A module of the core, not
//           a crate, so CI and the binary run identical rules.
