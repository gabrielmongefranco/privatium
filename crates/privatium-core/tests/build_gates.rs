// Summary: The build gates: each test proves an engine compiled from source — the bundled SQLite, the
//          vendored Lua 5.4 — links and runs on all three CI platforms, before anything is
//          built on it. They are named for the risk they close, not for a spec section,
//          because none of them enforces a normative MUST.
// Notes: See README file for documentation and full license information.
