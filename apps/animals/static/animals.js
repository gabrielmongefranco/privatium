 * Summary:  Alpine components for the two interactions in this app that are
 *           purely visual. Everything that changes data is HTMX, not this file.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AT ALL, RATHER THAN INLINE x-data
 * -----------------------------------------------------
 * A Privatium app is served with `script-src 'self'` and no 'unsafe-eval'
 * (spec/app-contract.md §5.4). The *standard* Alpine build compiles attribute
 * expressions with the Function constructor, so `x-data="{ open: false }"` and
 * `@click="open = !open"` cannot run under that policy at all.
 *
 * The CSP build (vendored as alpine-csp.min.js — see VENDOR.md) removes that
 * requirement by removing inline expressions: every x-data must name a component
 * registered here, and every binding must reference one of its properties or
 * methods *by key*. That is more verbose and it is the correct trade. Setting
 * `eval = true` in app.toml to keep the shorter syntax would hand any injected
 * string a JavaScript engine, which is the whole thing the policy prevents.
 *
 * Rule of thumb for anything added here:
 *
 *     If losing it on refresh loses data, it is HTMX.
 *     If losing it on refresh is fine, it is Alpine.
 *
 * Nothing in this file writes an event, and nothing in this file should.

   *
   * A show/hide toggle. Nothing is persisted, because nothing here is worth
   * persisting — reopening the page with everything collapsed is the correct
   * behaviour, not a bug. Long question paths are the reason this exists:
   * collapsed by default keeps the table scannable, which matters more than
   * usual for the dyslexia-friendly target in docs/architecture.md. */

    open: false,

      this.open = !this.open;

   *
   * Replaces `onsubmit="return confirm(...)"`. That attribute was a real bug,
   * not a style preference: an inline event handler is script, and this app's
   * CSP does not allow 'unsafe-inline', so it would simply never have fired.
   *
   * This is deliberately *not* a data-safety mechanism. Reset writes tombstones
   * and the log keeps every round ever played (see README), so the worst case is
   * an inconvenience. It is here because a destructive button deserves a second
   * step, and that step is ephemeral UI. */
