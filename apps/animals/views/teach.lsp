     Summary: The learning form. One HTMX-free page, on purpose.

     This form is a navigation: you arrive here from the board and leave to the
     board. Swapping it in place would mean owning the back button, so it stays a
     plain post. The only Alpine on the page is a help disclosure, which is the
     clearest possible case of "losing it on refresh costs nothing" — and with
     JavaScript off the examples are simply shown (static/nojs.css). --?>

      Avoid questions about what *you* think of it. "Is it scary?" splits the tree
      differently every time you play.
