# animals — Tier 1 at its interesting end

The guess-the-animal game that shipped with every BASIC and Unix system worth using. It
knows nothing at first and learns one animal per round, forever.

It is here because it forces the framework to prove things `hello` does not.

## What it demonstrates

| Feature | Where |
|---|---|
| **Multi-event atomic writes** | `app.lua` → `pv.batch` emits three events as one |
| **`tx.append` returning minted ULIDs** | The new leaves are referenced before they exist |
| **Recursive SQL over event-sourced rows** | `lib/tree.lua` → `knowledge()` |
| **Stored session state** | The `cursor` table — a round survives a reload and continues on another device |
| **Splitting logic out of routes** | `lib/tree.lua` is `require`d by name |
| **Tombstones** | `reset` empties the tree; the log keeps every round you played |
| **Accessible forms** | `fieldset`/`legend` for the radio pair, labels on every input |
| **The HTMX / Alpine boundary** | Both on one screen — see below |
| **Progressive enhancement** | `app.lua` → `board()` returns a fragment or a redirect |
| **A strict CSP, satisfied** | `static/animals.js` — Alpine's CSP build, no `eval` |

## Why this app exists, in one sentence

**The animal tree *is* the event log.** The system learns by appending, and nothing is ever
updated. Teach it "ostrich" and that is a new line in a JSONL file you can `cat`. That is
the founding invariant made visible to a non-technical person in about fifteen seconds —
`hello` cannot show it without ceasing to be minimal, and `sketch` never touches SQL.

## HTMX and Alpine, on one screen

These are often described as opposite philosophies. They are better understood as
complementary halves of one rule:

> **If losing it on refresh loses data, it is HTMX.
> If losing it on refresh is fine, it is Alpine.**

`animals` has both, unforced:

| Interaction | Tool | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Submit a guess | HTMX | appends an event |
| Teach a new animal | HTMX | appends events, atomically |
| Tree fragment re-renders | HTMX | the node owns the truth |
| "Show the question path" disclosure | Alpine | pure UI, nothing persisted |
| Show example questions when teaching | Alpine | a hint, not an answer |
| Confirm before forgetting everything | Alpine | ephemeral by definition |

Two cases that look like exceptions and are not. **Teaching and forgetting are
plain form posts**, not HTMX, because they are navigations — a separate page you
arrive at and leave, and swapping a fragment there means owning the back button.
And **every HTMX form still carries `method` and `action`**: `hx-post` is an
enhancement, and `board()` in `app.lua` returns a fragment or a redirect depending
on `req.is_htmx`, so recording a guess never requires JavaScript.

The rule has a corollary the Alpine half has to honour too: **every write is reachable
with JavaScript off.** Alpine hides the reset form behind a confirmation and the
question paths behind a toggle, and without Alpine nothing would ever reveal them. So
`views/_assets.lsp` links `static/nojs.css` from a `<noscript>` — an external sheet,
since the default CSP has no `style-src` and an inline `<style>` would be dropped — which
reverts `x-cloak` and hides the buttons marked `pv-js-only`, the ones whose only job is
to toggle Alpine state. With JavaScript off the paths are printed and the reset form is
simply on the page: one step instead of two, and nothing you can do with scripts that you
cannot do without them.

### Alpine here is the CSP build, and that is the interesting part

An app runs under `script-src 'self'` with no `'unsafe-eval'`
(`spec/app-contract.md §5.4`). Standard Alpine compiles `x-data="{ open: false }"`
with the `Function` constructor, so it cannot run at all under that policy. The
CSP build trades inline expressions for registered components: `x-data` names
something in `static/animals.js`, and bindings reference its properties and
methods by key.

That is more typing and it is the right trade — the alternative is granting the
app `eval`, which hands any injected string a JavaScript engine to save a few
characters. An earlier version of `knowledge.lsp` used
`onsubmit="return confirm(...)"`, which was not a style problem but a silent
failure: an inline handler is script, and the policy blocks it.

One more thing the browser taught this app: `static/animals.js` must load **before**
Alpine. Alpine's CDN builds start themselves in a microtask as soon as their script runs,
and `alpine:init` fires right then — a component registered afterwards does not exist as
far as Alpine is concerned, and every `x-data` is an "Undefined variable" in the console.
`views/_assets.lsp` keeps the order, both scripts `defer`.

Each use is commented in the source with *why that tool*, not *how it works*. The teaching
happens in the contrast, on one page.

Across the three reference apps a reader sees all three postures without a comparison
document: server-owned state (`animals`, HTMX), client-owned ephemeral state (`animals`,
Alpine), and client-owned everything (`sketch`).

## The learning step

You land on a leaf. The app guesses "is it a *penguin*?" You say no, and tell it you meant a
*wombat*, distinguished by "does it have cubic droppings?"

The naive move creates a new question node and re-points the parent at it — but the parent
may not exist (this could be the root), and finding it means a traversal.

Instead, **the leaf becomes the question, in place, keeping its own ULID:**

```
before:                  after:
                                [does it have cubic droppings?]
   [penguin]      →             /                            \
                           yes /                              \ no
                       [wombat]                            [penguin]
```

Three `put` events: one rewriting the leaf into a branch, two creating fresh leaves. The
parent is never touched, and every existing pointer into the tree stays correct because the
branch reuses the leaf's id.

That is only clean when identity is a ULID you control and writes are appends.

## Sample data

`sample/seed.jsonl` holds seven events — three questions and four animals — so a fresh
node can play a round before it has taught anything. It is offered on the settings page
while the app's log is empty and loaded only when you ask (`spec/app-contract.md §9`); the
events are appended as this node's own, with fresh envelopes. There is no `cursor` row in
it, so the first round starts at the root.

## Reading your own game history

```bash
jq -r '[.ts, .op, .d.text] | @tsv' data/animals/log/*.jsonl
```

Every animal you ever taught it, in order, including the ones you reset away.

## Later: the sync demo

Once `spec/protocol.md §10` lands (roadmap Phase 3), this app becomes the best
demonstration of sync in the repository. Wire the history fragment to `/api/stream` with the
HTMX SSE extension — one attribute — and teaching an animal on the desktop updates the
phone's history live, on screen, with no polling code and no reload. Two devices, one
visible cause and effect.
