# Privatium

## Project preferences

Use this skill when planning, implementing, or reviewing changes in this repository. It
supplements [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md), especially section 3, and cannot weaken its
security, privacy, accessibility, licensing, testing, or authorization rules.

### Header format

Section 3 of `AGENTS.md` gives the format, and every checked file in this repository now
carries it, in that language's comment syntax. Two details are specific to Privatium.

Source files take the GNU General Public License notice. Markdown under `spec/` and
`docs/` takes the GNU Free Documentation License notice instead, because documentation is
licensed separately. The notes line reads exactly `See README file for documentation and
full license information.` and stays whole on one line, so both a reader and the checker
can find it.

`.lsp` templates carry a reduced header: the project line, the file's own path, the
summary, and the notes line. Authorship and a full licence notice on every partial of an
app that nobody reads separately is noise.

### What is checked

`cargo xtask header-check` covers `.rs`, `.lua`, `.sql`, `.js`, `.css`, `.lsp`, and `.md`
under `spec/` and `docs/`.

Markdown elsewhere is exempt by design: this file, `README.md`, every `apps/**` README and
`SKILL.md`, and everything under `skills/` are prose rather than source. `.html` and
`.toml` are exempt too. Manifests carry a header by convention here and should keep doing
so, but the convention is not enforced.

Anything vendored is exempt and must stay that way, since third-party code carries its own
provenance. The marker is a `VENDOR.md` beside the file or above it. Minified bundles are
exempt as well, because a minifier discards comments.

Dates are checked for shape, not accuracy. A mechanical `Last Modified:` check would either
be wrong or fight every commit that touches the file. Update it yourself on a material
change.

### Verification

`cargo xtask header-check` is the check of record. Run it after adding or editing any file
it covers, and fix what it reports rather than exempting the file.
