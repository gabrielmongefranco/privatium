# Roadmap

Each phase ends with something usable. No phase depends on a later one to be worth
shipping. Acceptance criteria are written so that "done" is not a matter of opinion.

## Phase 1 — A node that works on one machine

**Deliverable:** a binary you run, that serves the `hello` app in a browser on the same
machine, and stores its data as JSONL.

Scope: `privatium-core` (log, store, app loader), **the `Request`/`Response` interface and
the axum adapter (ADR 0003)**, the Lua host (mlua, sandbox, VM pool),
the LSP compiler with hot reload, HTTP server, HTMX shell, SQLite materialization,
snapshots, three-tier restore, the Tier 2 data API and `pv.js`, and the CLI including
`privatium dev`, `new`, and `lint` (`spec/cli.md`).

**Done when** — each bullet names the test that holds it, under `crates/*/tests/`; the
CI matrix runs every one on Linux, macOS and Windows:
- [x] `hello` and `animals` (Tier 1) load, render, and accept writes —
      `test_hello_end_to_end`, `test_animals_end_to_end`
- [x] `sketch` (Tier 2) works with its own JavaScript and no `schema.sql` —
      `test_sketch_end_to_end`, `test_sketch_works_without_schema_sql`
- [x] Editing a `.lsp` file is visible on the next request — no restart, no build —
      `test_hot_reload_template_next_request`
- [x] The Lua sandbox rejects `io`, `os.execute`, and `debug`, and enforces all four limits —
      `test_spec_lua_5_banned_globals_absent`, `test_spec_lua_5_instruction_limit_aborts`,
      `test_spec_lua_5_memory_limit_aborts`, `test_spec_lua_5_wallclock_limit_aborts`, and
      the pool size by `test_spec_lua_5_limit_does_not_kill_node` (a pool of one)
- [x] Solo mode serves one app at `/` with no launcher — `test_solo_mode_mounts_at_root`,
      `test_launcher_absent_in_solo_mode`
- [x] `privatium lint` passes on every reference app and fails on seeded violations —
      `test_reference_apps_lint_clean`, `test_spec_cli_5_lint_exit_codes_and_formats`
- [x] Every lint rule in `spec/cli.md §5` has both a passing and a failing case under
      `apps/_lint/pass/<rule>/<slug>/` and `apps/_lint/fail/<rule>/<slug>/` — not in
      `apps/` proper, where the loader would try to mount them —
      `test_every_rule_has_fixtures`, `test_spec_cli_5_4_lint_corpus_files_all_belong_to_a_rule`
- [x] `--format json` findings each carry a resolvable `spec` reference —
      `test_every_finding_has_resolvable_spec_ref`,
      `test_spec_cli_5_2_json_findings_carry_seven_fields`
- [x] `privatium dev` reloads Lua, templates, and schema with no restart —
      `test_hot_reload_app_lua_reregisters_routes`, `test_hot_reload_template_next_request`,
      `test_hot_reload_schema_rematerializes`, `test_spec_cli_3_dev_names_the_app`
- [x] `privatium-core` compiles and runs standalone in a 30-line embedded example —
      `test_spec_app_contract_2_3_example_is_thirty_lines_of_the_spec_shape`,
      `test_spec_app_contract_2_3_open_app_append_query_with_no_folder`, and CI runs the
      example (`.github/scripts/embedded-example.sh`)
- [x] Every application route is reachable as `core::handle(Request) -> Response` with no
      socket, and the HTTP server is a thin adapter over it (ADR 0003) —
      `test_spec_9_1_every_prefix_reachable_through_handle`,
      `test_adapter_registers_no_routes_of_its_own`
- [x] `Request` and `Response` bodies are streams in both directions — `/api/stream` is
      served without buffering, and a large upload never lands in memory whole —
      `test_response_body_streams_without_buffering`,
      `test_large_request_body_never_fully_buffered`
- [x] `rm -rf cache/ data/*/snap/` then restart → identical state —
      `test_spec_3_1_delete_cache_loses_nothing` (digests before and after), and
      `test_hello_end_to_end` removes the cache and the snapshots and reopens
- [x] A hand-written JSONL line appended by `echo` appears in the UI after reload
      *(this is the test that keeps `AGENTS.md` invariant 1 honest — the live tail stays
      plain, uncompressed JSONL no matter what sealed segments become)* —
      `test_hand_appended_line_visible_without_restart`,
      `test_hello_readme_echo_example_is_valid`
- [x] Conformance checklist items for §3, §4, §5 pass — the names in
      `docs/plans/phase-1.md §7`, run by `.github/scripts/conformance.sh` with `--exact`
- [x] Runs on Linux, Windows and macOS from a single binary — the CI matrix runs the
      suite on all three, `test_r1_sqlite_bundled_links` and
      `test_r2_mlua_vendored_links_and_is_lua_54` prove the engines on each, and the
      release binary is uploaded in a single-binary archive per operating system

## Phase 2 — Other devices on the LAN

**Deliverable:** open the app on your phone by scanning a QR code.

Scope: pairing (SPAKE2, RFC 9382), emoji pad + word codes, session crypto in Rust and JS,
device registry, mDNS + UDP discovery, key pinning.

Plan: `docs/plans/phase-2.md`.

M14 implements cluster identity, node certificates and the derived X25519 static key.
M15 adds session key agreement, encrypted frames and handshake helpers in Rust and
JavaScript. M16 adds pairing — the 16-bit code in both renderings, SPAKE2 as RFC 9382
specifies it, the six messages of `/ws/pair`, the in-memory window with its limits and
audit rows, and the device row a success writes — in Rust and JavaScript, as data a
test drives. M17 connects `/ws/pair` and `/ws` to the live core, binds the LAN interfaces,
and routes browser pages, forms, HTMX and the data API through the encrypted channel.
Full-page responses can cross document transitions without repeating a write. Named
socket and browser-module tests are in the plan. M18 adds discovery: the TXT record of
§6.1, mDNS advertisement and browsing, the UDP responder and probe of §6.4, both started
together and stopped with the node, the `pair` flag from one source, and a real
`--no-discovery`. M19 adds the surfaces: the pairing screen in the browser with the
emoji pad and the word field, the code page and the devices page on the node with label
and revoke, the display-name form, `/api/v1/pair` for the owner alone, `privatium pair`,
the QR code and the first-run window behind `--open`, and `--version` claiming `pv/1
(partial: phase 2)`. The hardening round after M19 bound an accepted pairing attempt
to its code and its window, escaped the devices page's IDs, bounded the UDP responder
and the records read off the network, and put a time bound on a silent peer
(`docs/plans/phase-2.md`, "Phase 2 hardening"). The bullets that need a person — a
phone, a screen reader, Wireshark — stay open until the manual pass is recorded.

**Done when:**
- [ ] Pairing completes on a phone in under 20 seconds, without a keyboard — the
      automated half is `test_spec_8_3_browser_client_against_live_core` and
      `test_spec_7_2_pad_and_word_field_yield_the_same_sixteen_bits`; the phone and the
      stopwatch are a manual pass
- [ ] Word-code path completes with the screen reader on and images disabled — the
      markup is held by `test_spec_cli_5_pv4xx_pairing_and_devices_pages`; the screen
      reader is a manual pass
- [ ] Wireshark on the LAN shows no plaintext application data — automated as
      `test_spec_8_2_lan_socket_carries_no_plaintext_app_data`; a person with Wireshark
      still looks (`docs/plans/phase-2.md` R16)
- [x] Changing the node key produces the full-screen refusal with no override —
      `test_spec_8_1_a_reinitialized_node_is_refused_by_a_paired_client`,
      `test_spec_8_1_refusal_screen_has_no_dismiss` (JavaScript)
- [x] Two nodes on one LAN are distinguishable in the discovery list by ID, not name —
      `test_spec_6_1_two_nodes_with_one_name_are_distinct_by_id`,
      `test_spec_6_1_mdns_registration_is_browsable_and_keyed_by_id`
- [x] Conformance checklist items for §6, §7, §8 pass — `.github/scripts/conformance.sh`
      runs every item Phase 2 can claim by name (`docs/plans/phase-2.md §7`), green on
      all three platforms on the run of `main` at `8ca618d`; the `cl` filter of §6.1
      needs a second node and is Phase 3's

## Phase 3 — More than one node

**Deliverable:** desktop and laptop stay in sync with no server, and one pairing covers both.

Scope: cluster identity and node admission, node certificates, sync protocol over LAN HTTP,
filesystem watcher for externally-synced logs, endpoint candidate list with failover, and
**attachments** — binary files beside the log, content-addressed, synced as a set union.

Plan: `docs/plans/phase-3.md`.

**Done when:**
- [ ] A second node is admitted with one pairing; the phone reaches it **without re-pairing**
- [ ] Discovery filters to your own cluster on a LAN carrying a stranger's node
- [ ] **The power-cut case:** desktop off, phone syncs to laptop, desktop wakes and catches up
      with no conflict and no lost writes
- [ ] Edit offline on both machines, reconnect, both converge
- [ ] Syncthing on `data/` alone produces the same convergence with sync disabled
- [ ] A `seq` gap is detected and repaired rather than appended
- [ ] Lamport counters survive restart and remain monotonic
- [ ] Cluster private key is absent from every event, snapshot, and backup export
- [ ] Killing the active endpoint fails over in under 5 seconds, not 30
- [ ] An attachment stored on one node reaches every other node and every restore; a file
      whose bytes do not match its hash is refused, never served
- [ ] `rm -rf cache/ data/*/snap/` then restart → identical state, attachments included

**Sync demo, once §10 works:** wire `animals` to `/api/stream` with the HTMX SSE extension.
Teaching an animal on the desktop makes the phone's history update live, on screen, with no
polling code and no page reload. Two devices, one visible cause and effect — a far better
demonstration than a passing test, and it costs one attribute.

**Attachments, once §10 works:** a photo of a prescription or a PDF has no home in a JSONL
line. Phase 3 adds `data/<slug>/blob/<sha256>` — immutable files named by their own hash,
referenced from `d`, synced as a set union exactly as the logs are, and copied by the same
backup. Never a mutable file sync: a file edited in place can conflict, and nothing in this
design may. `spec/protocol.md §14` item 8 records the constraints; the wire shape lands with
the milestone in `docs/plans/phase-3.md`.

## Phase 3b — The always-on node

**Deliverable:** the phone works on cellular.

Scope: documentation and a VPS quickstart. **No new protocol** — an always-on node is an
ordinary cluster member.

**Done when:**
- [ ] A VPS node is admitted with the same flow as a laptop
- [ ] Phone on cellular, both home machines off, reads and writes still work
- [ ] Destroying and rebuilding the VPS node loses nothing
- [ ] Nothing in the codebase distinguishes it from any other node

## Phase 3c — Household profiles

**Deliverable:** the people in one home each get their own view of an app, behind an
optional PIN, and an app can exchange fast-moving state between devices without writing it
to the log.

Scope: profiles as a partition, segment directories under each app, `usr` in the envelope,
shared tables declared in `app.toml`, and an ephemeral message channel for apps that update
many times a second — a racing game's positions, not its results.

Decided in `docs/decisions/0007-household-profiles.md`. Planned in
`docs/plans/phase-3.md`.

**What it is not.** Profiles are not accounts and never hide anything from someone holding
the node's files. There is no profile merge. **No node is ever told to delete data:** a
segment can be deleted locally, and a peer that still holds it will hand it back. That is
the price of sharing a cluster, and the interface says so rather than implying otherwise.

**Done when:**
- [ ] Two profiles on one node cannot read each other's rows, in Tier 1 and Tier 2 alike
- [ ] An app hidden from a profile by `sys_app_grant` explains itself and offers the switcher
- [ ] A profile's data can be deleted from a node without rewriting any log
- [ ] A table declared `shared` is readable and writable by every profile
- [ ] A PIN locks out after 5 attempts and every attempt is audited
- [ ] Solo mode still renders no framework chrome, and the switcher is still reachable
- [ ] A dropped connection resumes the same profile without a PIN prompt
- [ ] Two devices exchange 20 messages a second with no line appended to any log

## Phase 4 — Native shells

**Deliverable:** installable desktop app, and Android and iOS apps.

Scope: Tauri v2 desktop, Tauri mobile, `uniffi` bindings, **`privatium-ffi` (the C ABI)**,
offline read + write outbox. Mobile clients live in separate repositories depending on
`privatium-core`.

The shells are adapters over `core::handle` (ADR 0003), so they add no routing work. The
desktop shell gets offline for free: the core is in-process, so there is no service worker,
no PWA manifest, no certificate, and no domain — see `docs/architecture.md §2.5`.

**Open risk, carried deliberately:** custom-scheme *streaming* in a platform webview,
particularly WKWebView, is unproven. `spec/data-api.md §3` therefore specifies long-poll as
a conformant fallback for `/api/stream`. Because `Response` is stream-shaped in the core,
this is a transport swap rather than a refactor. The spike belongs to the mobile
repositories, not to Phase 1.

**New reference app: `lantern` (Tier 3).** A deliberately trivial LÖVE game — one button,
dodge falling shapes, run ends — linking `privatium-ffi` through LuaJIT's FFI. Each run
appends one event. Paired with a small Tier 1 app rendering run history, personal bests, and
per-device statistics in the browser: start a run on the desktop, see it on the phone. The
game is trivial on purpose; the demonstration is the C ABI and the log, not the gameplay.

**Done when:**
- [ ] Desktop app works with the network cable unplugged
- [ ] Mobile app pairs, syncs, and survives airplane mode with queued writes
- [ ] Native mDNS discovery works on Android (NSD) and iOS (Bonjour, with the local
      network permission prompt handled)
- [ ] **The Wi-Fi-to-cellular transition:** switch mid-session, app keeps working, queued
      writes replay, no re-pairing, no duplicated rows
- [ ] Native clients hold and fail over a multi-endpoint list; browser clients hold one
- [ ] `sys_device.replica` is reported accurately by every client kind, and **reachability
      is reported separately** — a phone is a full replica whose reachability is
      foreground-only (ADR 0005)
- [ ] Mobile resolves discovery records but does not publish them by default; publishing is
      a setting, off by default
- [ ] `lantern` runs as a native LÖVE binary against `privatium-ffi` with no node process,
      and its paired Tier 1 app renders the same runs in a browser

## Phase 5 — Reaching home from outside

**Deliverable:** the app works on cell data with **no account, no domain, and no payment**,
and installs as a PWA for those who want one.

### 5a — pkarr discovery

Small, useful alone, and does not constrain 5b. Replaces DDNS for anyone willing to forward
one port.

- [ ] Node publishes signed records to the mainline DHT under its own key
- [ ] Records stay under 1000 bytes and carry no application data
- [ ] Republishes on a timer and on address change; a sleeping node vanishes within hours
- [ ] Uses BEP44 mutable items, never BEP5 infohash announcements
- [ ] Publishing is disableable independently of resolving
- [ ] Concurrent DNS resolution works on a network with the DHT blocked

### 5b — Direct peer transport

- [ ] Phone on cellular reaches a home node with no VPN, tunnel, DDNS, or account
- [ ] Laptop elsewhere reaches the desktop at home, same conditions
- [ ] Relay fallback works when hole punching fails; `p2p.relay_only` forces it
- [ ] A self-hosted relay is configurable and the public default is disableable
- [ ] Audit distinguishes `p2p.direct` from `p2p.relayed` so an owner can see which is in use

### 5c — Routes retained

- [ ] Mesh VPN path works with zero Privatium configuration
- [ ] DuckDNS + Let's Encrypt issues and auto-renews without inbound ports
- [ ] PWA install prompt appears only on a secure context and never on plain HTTP
- [ ] `.onion` address resolves and serves, with the manual `torrc` route documented
- [ ] Cloudflare Tunnel documented, not implemented
- [ ] mDNS and the LAN address still work with every one of the above disabled

## Phase 6 — Packaging

**Deliverable:** install it the way your distribution expects.

Scope: `.deb`, `.rpm`, AppImage, Flatpak, MSI, notarized `.app`, and per-OS firewall
guidance (`docs/deployment.md §4`).

**Done when:**
- [ ] Fresh installs accept an inbound LAN connection on Windows, macOS, Debian, Ubuntu,
      Fedora, and openSUSE — or explain in plain language what to run, without demanding it
- [ ] The node never requires administrator privileges to run
- [ ] mDNS works, i.e. UDP 5353 is handled as its own rule and not forgotten
- [ ] Flatpak build passes with no `--filesystem=host`
- [ ] Owner-chosen data directory works through the file-chooser portal, sandboxed
- [ ] Autostart uses the Background portal
- [ ] mDNS works inside the sandbox

## Phase 7 — The first real app

**Deliverable:** the medication fill / prior-authorization tracker, in a separate
repository, as an app folder.

This is the proof. If it needs a framework change to work, the framework was wrong and the
change belongs in `pv/1` before the app ships.

## Ongoing, not a phase

`skills/` ships and versions with the code. A change to `spec/` without the matching skill
update is incomplete (`AGENTS.md`). `privatium lint` is what makes the skills enforceable
rather than advisory, so it lands in Phase 1, not later.

## Open questions, not yet scheduled

Each of these is worth prototyping before it is worth specifying. None is a deliverable.

### Tier 1 rendering offline

Tier 1 renders on the node, so a cached shell gives offline access to views already
*visited*. Rendering an unvisited view needs handler logic in the browser. Three options,
in increasing ambition:

1. **Accept the limit.** Offline Tier 1 = visited views plus queued writes. Probably
   sufficient — this morning's list, this evening's entry. Zero new machinery, and this is
   the specified behaviour until something replaces it.
2. **Ship Lua to the browser.** `wasmoon` runs Lua 5.4 in WASM. Run the *same* `app.lua` and
   the *same* compiled LSP templates client-side — no second implementation and therefore no
   drift, which is the objection that rules out client frameworks in the first place. The
   open problem is the query layer: Tier 1 handlers run SQL against SQLite.
3. **Tier 2.** Already works. The author owns their client code.

### SQLite in the browser for offline Tier 1 queries

The node's engine is SQLite (`docs/decisions/0006`), and SQLite runs in a browser as WASM —
`wa-sqlite` or `sql.js` — with the same dialect, so a view written once in `schema.sql`
means the same thing on the node and in the page. Two things to settle before it is
adopted:

- **Payload over cellular.** Measure the gzipped size of the build. That number decides it.
- **No shared-memory build.** A build that needs `SharedArrayBuffer` requires cross-origin
  isolation, which would break host mode for every other app on the node
  (`docs/frameworks.md §5.4`). The asynchronous, single-threaded build is the only
  candidate, regardless of how the benchmarks come out.

If it does not work out, option 2 above still stands with a narrower offline query
surface. It is not load-bearing for it.

### Passing data between node Lua and browser Lua

Useful if browser Lua happens, and worth keeping even if browser SQLite does not. **The
mechanism already exists: it is the event log.** Events are JSON, JSON maps to Lua tables,
and both sides already agree on the shape. Do not build a second serialisation path, a
shared-state abstraction, or transparent RPC — those work in a demo and leak at every
failure boundary. Keep it explicit and JSON-shaped.

### PWA client replica

Wanted for people on a real HTTPS origin, and clearly the second path after the native
shell — build the shell first, since it needs no replica at all. When built, it is the event
log's `(dev, lam)` watermark plus an outbox, roughly 300 lines, not a third-party sync
library (`docs/decisions/0004 §2`).

## Explicitly not on the roadmap

Multi-user sharing **as a hosted service**, an app registry, a plugin API, cloud hosting, a
mobile SDK for third parties, and a hosted sync relay. Each of these turns a personal tool
into a service, which is the thing this project exists to avoid.

Sharing between two households is a different thing, and it is not excluded — it needs
identities that can be proved, so it waits for `pv/2`
(`docs/decisions/0007-household-profiles.md`). Household profiles on one node are Phase 3c
below.

And no `doctor` subcommand. Failures should be detected and explained where they occur.
